        Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The
        Coca-Cola Company. Originally marketed as a temperance drink and
        intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century
        by John Stith Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs
        Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the
        world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The drink's name
        refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves, and kola nuts (a
        source of caffeine). The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade
        secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental
        recreations have been published. The drink has inspired imitators and
        created a whole classification of soft drink: colas. The Coca-Cola
        Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola
        bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive
        territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in
        cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered
        water and sweeteners. A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains
        38 grams (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high-fructose corn
        syrup in North America). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and
        merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending
        machines throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells
        concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice
        distributors.

        League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
        multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
        Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
        Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
        the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been
        free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
        customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In
        the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player
        combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of
        the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique
        abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become
        more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and
        purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode,
        Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and
        destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

        A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for
        transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on
        roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport
        people rather than goods.[2][3] Cars came into global use during the
        20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is
        regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Karl Benz
        patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[1][4][5] Cars became widely
        available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to
        the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the
        Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they
        replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.[6] In Europe and other parts
        of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World
        War II.[6] Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort,
        and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and
        controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more
        complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning,
        navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the
        early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by
        the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early
        in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s
        and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before
        2025.[7][8] The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features
        prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[9] such as
        Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[10]
